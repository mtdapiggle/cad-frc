# cad-frc
bad frc cadding (v2)

# session 1:
i've been putting off doing frc cadding, but here i am again.
ok, so i wanna do 2024 this time.
also, i learned about some new design techniques during the time that i did my previous frc cad, and between this session and the last frc cad session
the first one is called master sketching
i'm still not entirely sure on how it works/what you're meant to do, but you basically plan out the location of pulleys motors and moving stuff, before deciding on the shape of the plate. 
https://www.frcdesign.org/best-practices/mastersketch-setup/
ok i was wrong, maybe it isn't the motor  location, i guess that can change and stuff. 
the other one is called parametric designing
i don't know how to explain it, but an experienced cadder in the team told me that it's like making your part studio look like your assembly. i kinda liked the idea because then i wouldn't have to fasten 10000 things again.

https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/full-robot-design-thought-process-workflow/443307
this is made by a guy called david, who also made frcdesign.org
i wasn't sure how you were meant to get bearings and pulleys in, until i looked through my featurescripts and found
"in-place bearings" and
"belt and pulley gen"
but i don't think i can generate motors, which is fine.
i'm just going to fuse a bunch of robots again, but also try to understand why they did a thing that they did.
(aka how their robot systems work and stuff.)
ok so
254 hadn't yet released their tech binder :(
althoughhhh
1678 has released their cad (only their cad) and a strategy document

uhhhhhhhhhhhh so i forgot the key words.
erm
what were they again ???

ah right, a build thread.
finding "open alliance" has 612341824 trillion different build threads
https://www.chiefdelphi.com/tag/openalliance
i'm just gonna drop the build thread links here.

there's a lot more to go through, so uh... time to scroll i guess

where onshape link :( it's after kickoff :(
me watching the 4 onshape tabs eat all of my ram
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a91ebc8-0be0-4742-8f9a-862b45841487)
ok, so 111 uses an under the bumper intake
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e950ab89-32ea-4f71-982b-3b4ca906a542)
that goes into an adjustable angle shooter.
they also have a climber.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd3e4c0c-e530-41ad-85e2-0ca49fefe146)
they also use a crank or a linkage or something to move the adjustable angle shooter up and down which is quite interesting.

dude i have no idea what's going on here.
i...
all i can see is an adjustable angle shooter
it just loooks like a mess of wheels and rollers elsewhere. i assume it's meant to be an intake.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2e43890-5575-42a0-adf6-59537abfbd78)
thisi makes much more sense, i was able to move the intake out.
ok, so the intake moves up and down using a sprocket and some chain, they have a climber.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40057577-87e2-4217-8ea7-1c8761d82152)
they make their shooter adjust angles by using a moving gear and a stationary gear. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/079c3e99-4c9a-4bb5-adb2-0c04b92b167b)
and their shooting is one sided?
i don't understand why
it's probably some mathematical concept that i don't know of (aka all of them)
